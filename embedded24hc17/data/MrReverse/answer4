Sometimes I think
Our heads might be enclosed
Closer together upon the pillow's space,
And how into the dark deeps of your eyes
I'd look and think of angels. Then your breath
And all the aura of your body's breathing
Intoxicatedly would overwhelm me
And I would die. For it is too much
That such a thing should be and I should live.
Surely the thought is greater than reality,
The sum of you and love outsteps infinity.
