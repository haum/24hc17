It is not, Celia, in our power
To say how long our love will last;
It may be we within this hour
May lose these joys we now do taste.
The Blessed, that immortal be,
From change in love are only free.
Then since we mortal lovers are,
Ask not how long our love will last;
But while it does, let us take care
Each minute be with pleasure past.
Were it not madness to deny
To live because we're sure to die?
