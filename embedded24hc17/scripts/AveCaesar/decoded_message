Time has come to prove your worth. In the next 24h (or less) you will have to
answer questions, solve problems, enigmas and maybe move your ass out of your
chair.
Vitellius will stay by your side as the good mentor he is. Please keep sending
him your guesses, he shall then give you the keys to move forward.

Vitellius is fair but hates loosers. Each time you fail, your chance of being
punished increases.

Prove you've decoded this message and say ave to the Laumio.
